# Real time vehicle speed estimation: leveraging YOLOv8 for object detection for accurate speed calculation.

This work for estimate the speed of vehicle. First we detected the vehicle and for that we used YOLOV8 algorithm. Once we detected the vehicle after that we applied a speed calculation formula on it. The factors such as the acceleration, distance travel, and the time elapsed were used to calculate the speed of a vehicle. This technoligy can be valuable for various purposes such as:

Traffic Management: It can assist traffic authorities in monitoring and managing traffic flow by identifying congested areas or potential traffic violations.

Law Enforcement: Police officers can use it to enforce speed limits and identify vehicles that are speeding, aiding in the prevention of accidents and ensuring road safety.

Accident Reconstruction: In the event of an accident, a speed estimation application can provide valuable data for accident reconstruction, helping investigators determine the cause and contributing factors.

Fleet Management: Companies with vehicle fleets can use speed estimation to monitor the driving behavior of their drivers, ensuring adherence to company policies and promoting safe driving practices.

Insurance Purposes: Insurance companies can use speed estimation data to assess risk and determine premiums for individual drivers or fleets.

Emergency Response: Emergency services can benefit from knowing the speed of vehicles in real-time, allowing them to respond more effectively to accidents, emergencies, or incidents on the road.

Navigation Systems: Speed estimation can enhance navigation systems by providing more accurate estimated arrival times based on current traffic conditions and speed data.

Transport Planning: Urban planners and transportation authorities can use speed estimation data to analyze traffic patterns, optimize road networks, and plan for future infrastructure improvements.

Overall, a speed estimation application can contribute to safer roads, more efficient transportation systems, and improved decision-making for various stakeholders involved in managing and using road networks.



## Model and Dataset
For this work we used YOLOv8 pretrained model which is trained on COCO dataset and COCO dataset have various classes. Some of them are car, truck, bus etc. We used this classes and this model to detect vehicle speed.
